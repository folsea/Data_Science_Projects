Dot_Plot_Book_store_inverntory:
I created an easy to ready dot plot to show how many books of various Genres where in a fictional Book Store. The chart is set up by x axis as the genre title and the Y axis the number of books increments of 5 and labeled ever 10 increments. I also have each dot labeled with the specific number that directly corresponds with the inventory number as if there were 22 book a 22 in is also labeled by the dot. I added a link to the file in my google Drive https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1dfyNF3C4xYMTj5dJ98iQCRbFLnLygdIx3Ji2o4Pcg/edit?usp=sharing
